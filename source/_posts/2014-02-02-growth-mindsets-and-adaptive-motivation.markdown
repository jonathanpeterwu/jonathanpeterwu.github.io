# Growth vs Fixed Mindset
###A look at how mindset dictate learning and acquiring skills.

I am currently taking a nine week bootcamp intensive called [devbootcamp](devbootcamp.com) in San Francisco learning web development with a rapid accelerated learning curve, looking at how learning mindset and motivation can affect growth.

![Growth Mindset][1]

####Keywords to know:
**Growth Mindset** - People believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. 
**Fixed Mindset** - In a fixed mindset people believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just inherent fixed traits

####**_Why is learning about mindset orientation key to learning?_** 
Understanding the fundamental difference between fixed and growth learning mindsets is key to predicting long term learning and mastery of a topic over time. In a nutshell, if you learn with the wrong mindset and approach, long term growth is limited. 
####**_What is intrinsic motivation?_**
Intrinsic motivation manifests itself when one can do an activity or learn a skill based purely on its inherent value. Think of this like whenever you learned something based on pure interest. Intrinsic motivation towards a subject can be one of the most powerful ways to quickly learn and master a topic

####**_What is the difference between fixed and growth mindset?_**
The fundamental difference between those that approach different things with a fixed and growth mindset, can come from the way they perceive intelligence. People who believe that intelligence is inherent, and the world is filled with dumb and smart people have an inherently fixed mindset.
Those who see intelligence as entirely malleable and changeable often see the world with a growth mindset.


####**_Seeing Growth vs Fixed Mindset in Action_**
We all face failure in our daily lives in different ways. Take a look at how somehow who has just done poorly on a test, or in an interview would respond:
**Fixed Mindset**
1) They encounter an event of adversity
2) They reason with the emotional outfall from the failure
3) They blame the situation, event, or exterior events for their failure
4) They console themselves by proving that they are smart.


**Growth Mindset**
1) They encounter an event of adversity
2) They reason with the emotional outfall from the failure
3) The consider it a challenge to grow and learn more
4) They create a plan of attack that is vivid, clear, and actionable

> “So the idea is not only to make a growth-mindset plan, but also to visualize, in a concrete way, how you’re going to carry it ”



##**Extras**


####Cultivating a growth mindset in others

Ask probing question. Praise specifically on how hard they had worked on something

“What did you learn today?” “What mistake did you make that taught you something?” “What did you try hard at today?”

To live the growth mindset is to believe in the philosophy of growth.
