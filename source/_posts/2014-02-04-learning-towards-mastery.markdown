###A look at how Performance or Mastery oriented goals can affect your overall learning

I am currently taking a nine week bootcamp intensive called [devbootcamp](devbootcamp.com) in San Francisco learning web development with a rapid accelerated learning curve, looking at how learning mindset and motivation can affect growth.

####Keywords to know:

**Mastery Oriented Goals**
Desire to acquire additional knowledge and skills, self set standards, developing new skills
**Performance**
Ability to achieve high skill, focus on demonstrating competence, and ability judged relative to others, competition

####**_Why is learning about mastery oriented goal learning important?_** 
The difference between those who rapidly learn and retain things for long term learning and those that do not lay in the way they approach learning. Research has shown that the intrinsic motivation for learning is key in the long term success of people who are learning.

####**_What is the difference between mastery learning and performance learning?_**
Those who approach learning trying to achieve high scores, praise, and indicators of success, approach learning with a *performance goal orientation*. Meanwhile, those who approach learning trying to learn for the sake of learning, enjoy a challenge, and intrinsically want to learn something for the challenge and fun approach learning with a *mastery goal orientation*.

####**_Examples of performance vs. mastery oriented learning_**
To add a new wrinkle to mastery vs performance oriented learning, we will talk about approach and avoidance oriented goals. Put simply those with avoidance oriented goals, try to avoid others detecting what they do not know, they will study hard enough so that others don't see them falling behind. Those with approach oriented goals, want to learn to see how many things they can know about a subject. 
Now combining both performance, mastery, approach, and avoidance oriented goals we can now define a few key ones.

*Performance Approach Oriented* - people seek high grades in a class to show how much they've learned
*Performance Avoidance Oriented* - people seek passing high grades in a class to avoid showing what they don't know
*Mastery Approach Oriented* - people seek learning extensively for the sake of growing and learning.

##**Extras**

####Cultivating mastery oriented learning.

**Define why you want to learn a topic.**
Is it for the success and money? You may be taking a performance approach oriented approach.

Is it for the innate fun and challenge of it? You may be taking a mastery approach oriented approach.

Research has shown that Mastery Approach oriented learners both achieve more and learn more over time than those who are not.
